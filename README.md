i am new to programming,coding anll all tech languages, i heard about a github account for the first time 4 weeks ago and it has been an interesting journey.
i hope to learn and be the best of what i am and i know no knowledge is lost so i will put my all to ensure i am able to meet and even exceed my teachers expectations.
its so nice meeting and having a community of coders( if a word like that exists lol) i am honoured to be in your midst and looking forward to learning from all you amazing individuals.
thank you
